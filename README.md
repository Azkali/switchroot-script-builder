# switchroot-script-builder
Local build scripts for Switchroot Android Q


# Building
It's pretty straightforward--run the script with `sh Foster_Tab_Q_Build_Script.sh` and answer any prompts you get. Once stuff starts happening, there shouldn't be any more prompts unless you screwed something up

# Credits
@Dajokeisonu for his wonderful work on the base script

@PabloZaiden for his work on the Dockerized build
