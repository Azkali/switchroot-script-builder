# Switchroot Android Q Script Builder
One script to rule them all

# Features
Supports Android (`foster_tab`) and Android TV (`foster`)

Clean build and updates

OC coreboot (memory overclock)

OC patch (CPU)

Joycon patch (analog trigger emulation for xCloud, Steam Link, etc.)

`wdt` patch (TESTING PURPOSES ONLY)

GApps download

# Building
It's pretty straightforward--run the script with `sh Foster_Tab_Q_Build_Script.sh` and answer any prompts you get. Once stuff starts happening, there shouldn't be any more prompts unless you screwed something up
