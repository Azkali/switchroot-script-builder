# Switchroot Android Q Script Builder
One script to rule them all

# Features
Supports Android (`icosa`) (`foster_tab`) and Android TV (`foster`)

Clean build and updates

OC coreboot (memory overclock)

OC patch (CPU)

Joycon patch (snapshot button takes screenshots)

GApps download

Option to root (coming soon)

# Requirements
16GB RAM (or smaller amounts with a sizeable swapfile)

~300 GBs of available storage

Decent CPU (better CPU --> faster build)

# Building
It's pretty straightforward--first `chmod +x Q_Builder.sh` to make it executable, and run the script with `./Q_Builder.sh` and answer any prompts you get. Once stuff starts happening, there shouldn't be any more prompts unless you screwed something up
